# sql-challenge
Using [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com] website, I created the ERD diagram of the relationships between table, set the primery/foreign keys, and set the data types. After creating database in pgAdmin, I made tables in the schemas with the help of the ERD diagram. The last part was running the requested queries. 

The employee.sql has both the table schemata and and the queries. Table_schemata.sql  and queries.sql are the seperated sql files.
