# sql-challenge
Using [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com] website, I created the ERD diagram of the relationships between table, set the primery/foreign keys, and set the data types. After creating database in pgAdmin, I made tables in the schemas with the help of the ERD diagram. The last part was running the requested queries. 

The employee.sql has both the table schemata and and the queries. Table_schemata.sql  and queries.sql are the seperated sql files. The ERD diagram is saved as ERD.png.

With the bonus, after many tries, I couldn't get the first part of  importing the database and starting the postgresql engine. Unfortunately, I did not cemplete it.
